Panel is used to create dashboard layout, add widgets, and so on. 

For charting purposes, the Python data visualization library "hvplot" is used which lets us create interactive charts from Pandas data frame with one line of code.
It has the same API as pandas plotting API but charts are interactive as it uses the Python library "holoviews" (built on top of "Bokeh") to create charts.

hvplot -> Holoviews -> (Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib)
